# DPIC Take Home Assignment - César Núñez

This repository contains a complete data pipeline, analysis and visualization on enrollment and citizen grievances in Odisha, India. It uses two main sources: enrollment data from Industrial Training Institutes  and citizen complaints related to vocational education.

## **Part 1: Data Pipeline & Cleaning**

### Input Files:
- `iti_enrollments.csv`: District-level enrollment counts by year
- `grievances.json`: Citizen complaints 

### Process:
- Cleaning scripts standardize district names, handle missing data, and remove duplicates.
- Data is loaded into an SQLite DB (`data/dpic.db`) using `data_pipeline/load_data.py`.

### SQL Schema:
Defined in `sql/schema.sql`, with:
- `iti_enrollments` table
- `grievances` table
- `districts` table
- `itis` table

### Queries:
Saved in `sql/queries.sql` and executed via `data_pipeline/run_queries.py`:
- Year-wise enrollment trends by gender
- Year-wise grievences trends by type of grievances
- Grievances per 1000 enrolled students by district
- Districts with high enrollments but low grievance submissions
- Types of grievances per district
- Enrollment by program and district

## **Part 2: Pipeline Automation**

This Apache Airflow DAG mimics the weekly automation for the take home assignment. It includes the following tasks in a sequence:
1. `fetch_raw_data`: Fetches the latest raw data from a GitHub repository.
2. `clean_data`: Runs the data cleaning functions.
3. `load_db_data`: Inserts cleaned data into the database.
4. `send_email_summary`: Emails a summary report from the weekly automation.


## **Part 3: Visualization & Insights**

For the visualization, I used Dash for dashboard layout and Altair for the creation of charts.  

### Features:
- Summary of Odisha's enrollment and grievances statistics.
- Analyzing missmatch between enrollment and grievances on district level.
- Interactive summary statistics for enrollment and grievances on district level.
