# **Vocational Education Trends in Odisha**
This brief summarizes key findings from an analysis of ITI enrollments and grievance reports across Odisha’s districts.

**Odisha Trends in Enrollment and Grievances**
- Enrollment in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) has remained largely constant over recent years. However, in 2024 the enrollment surpase 1 million students which implied a 9.6% increase from 2023.
- The most frequently reported grievances are related to utilities such as water suply, non-working internet and lack of electricity during class hours
- These insights suggest growing student awareness and possibly deteriorating service conditions in some areas.

**Mismatch Between Enrollment and Grievances**
- Grievance rates vary significantly across districts, suggesting **unequal access to quality services** for vocational students.
- Districts with lower ITI enrollments tend to report **larger grievances per 1,000 students**.

**Policy Implications**
- Invest in basic utilities for vocational education centers, prioritizing districts with high grievance-to-enrollment ratios.
- Conduct further qualitative assessments to understand underreporting or overreporting patterns.
- Consider setting up a real-time grievance monitoring dashboard to guide resource allocation.
